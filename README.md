# 📡 AtliQo Telecom – 5G Performance Analysis (Power BI + SQL + DAX)

### 📊 End-to-End Data Analytics Project for Telecom Domain

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

**Context:**  
AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India. In **May 2022**, the company launched its **5G plans** along with other telecom operators.

Soon after the launch, the leadership team observed:

- Slower **revenue growth**
- Decline in **active users**
- Rising **unsubscribed customers**

They wanted to compare performance **before vs after 5G** and understand:

> “Did 5G actually help our business grow, or did pricing and competition push users away?”

**Goal:**  
Build a **data-driven Power BI dashboard** with SQL-backed validation to:

- Compare **pre-5G vs post-5G** performance
- Analyze **Revenue, ARPU, Active Users, Unsubscribed Users & Market Share**
- Identify which **cities, plans and competitors** are driving or hurting performance
- Recommend **pricing & retention strategies** for the management team

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> “How has AtliQo’s 5G launch impacted revenue, subscriber base, churn, and market share across cities and plans, and what strategic actions should management take to recover growth?”

Key business questions:

1. How did **Revenue, ARPU, Active Users & Unsubscribed Users** change **before vs after 5G**?
2. Which **cities** and **plans** performed the best and worst post-5G?
3. How did AtliQo’s **market share** change compared to competitors?
4. Are we **growing through healthy adoption** or **losing users due to aggressive pricing**?

## 🏗 Data Modeling

The project follows a **Star Schema** design for clear, performant analytics:

- **Fact Tables:**
  - `fact_atliqo_metrics`
  - `fact_market_share`
  - `fact_plan_revenue`

- **Dimension Tables:**
  - `dim_date`
  - `dim_cities`
  - `dim_plan`

**Key Relationships:**

- `dim_date[date]` ↔ `fact_atliqo_metrics[date]`  
- `dim_date[date]` ↔ `fact_plan_revenue[date]`  
- `dim_date[date]` ↔ `fact_market_share[date]`  
- `dim_cities[city_code]` ↔ all fact tables `[city_code]`  
- `dim_plan[plan]` ↔ `fact_plan_revenue[plans]`

The **`before_after_5g`** column in `dim_date` is used extensively to create pre vs post comparisons and time-matching logic.

> This model enables flexible slicing by **city**, **plan**, **time period**, and **company** while keeping the model simple and efficient.

- Conduct city-level % change analysis  
- Evaluate plan-wise performance  
- Calculate market share % and market value  
- Identify Top / Bottom performers  
- Derive churn metrics

This dual-layer validation ensures KPIs are accurate and reproducible outside the BI tool.

## 🧠 Key Business Insights

### 1️⃣ Overall Performance
- Active users **↓ ~8.3%** after 5G launch.
- Unsubscribed users increased by **↑ ~23.5%**, signaling churn pressure.
- ARPU increased by **↑ ~11%**, mainly due to higher 5G pricing. 
- Overall Revenue remained almost flat **↓ ~0.5%** despite ARPU growth.
- AtliQo’s Market Share dropped from approx. **20.2% → 19%** indicating competitive loss post-5G.

---

### 2️⃣ City-Level Insights
- Top 5 revenue-contributing cities: **Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai** — together contributing ~60% of total revenue.
- **Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad** show strong negative trends in active users and revenue after 5G.
- Pune is an outlier: active users increased despite higher churn — a high-potential growth market if retention improves.
- Cities such as **Raipur & Ahmedabad** show both user decline and weak revenue performance, indicating high risk.

---

### 3️⃣ Plan-Level Insights
- Plans **P1, P2, P3 & P11** contribute roughly 60–70% of total plan revenue.
- Plan **P11** (a post-5G plan) performs strongly and has good growth potential.
- Legacy plans like **P7–P10** show poor performance and are effectively discontinued post-5G.
- Revenue has been sustained due to high-ARPU plans rather than expanded user base — short-term gain but long-term risk.

---

### 4️⃣ Market Share Insights
- AtliQo remains at a consistent **3rd position** in market ranking.
- **Gurgaon & Lucknow** show the highest AtliQo market share (~21% share) strongholds.
- **Delhi & Hyderabad** show the lowest market share (~18%), where AtliQo is under strong competitor pressure.
- AtliQo’s share improved slightly before 5G but declined steadily post-launch, showing failed customer response to the new offering.

## 💡 Recommendations for Growth

| Area | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Pricing Strategy | Revisit 5G pricing in key metros (Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad) | Reduced churn, higher adoption, stabilized user base |
| Retention Campaigns | Run targeted offers & loyalty programs in high-churn cities | Recover lost users & protect revenue from competitors |
| Plan Portfolio | Promote strong performers (P1, P2, P3, P11); retire or rebrand weak plans | Higher plan stickiness and better customer satisfaction |
| Growth Markets | Double down on Pune, Gurgaon, Lucknow as high-potential growth cities | Accelerate user acquisition where adoption is positive |
| Market Share Recovery | Focus sales & marketing efforts in Delhi & Hyderabad | Regain lost share in strategically important markets |
| Customer Insight | Conduct surveys/interviews on 5G experience & price sensitivity | Align future plans with customer expectations |
